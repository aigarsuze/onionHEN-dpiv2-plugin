# Contributing

Keep contributions focused on making this repository a clear, reliable plugin
starting point. SDK ABI or host behavior changes belong in their respective
repositories.

All participation is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development setup

```sh
export PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK=/path/to/ps5-payload-sdk
cmake --preset ps5 \
  -DONIONHEN_PLUGIN_SDK_SOURCE=/path/to/onionHEN-plugin-sdk
cmake --build --preset ps5
```

Before submitting a change:

1. Build the plugin with the pinned SDK or a clearly identified SDK commit.
2. Confirm the post-build ELF descriptor validation succeeds.
3. Run `git diff --check`.
4. Update both READMEs when setup, behavior, or project structure changes.
5. Record PS5 hardware validation when the change affects runtime behavior.

## Design rules

- Keep process/session lifecycle in `source/main.c`.
- Keep UI construction and action handling in `source/plugin_ui.c`.
- Define plugin identity once in `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Use only the SDK's public C headers across the host boundary.
- Validate input and return specific `onion_status` errors.
- Acquire resources in one direction and release them in reverse order.
- Avoid adding abstractions unless they remove real duplication or isolate a
  dependency.

Do not commit build directories, ELF artifacts, PS5 SDK files, proprietary
libraries, decrypted system files, keys, console identifiers, or logs.

## Pull requests

Use a Conventional Commit subject, keep one logical change per pull request,
and explain the compatibility and hardware-validation status. By contributing,
you agree that your changes are licensed under this repository's GPL-3.0
license.
